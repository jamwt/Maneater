 [x] client sockets get closed/killed if no activity
     in N seconds
 [x] timeouts remove locks (and lock tracking)
 [ ] slave sync (get *?  value needs owner information)
 [ ] ensure slave sub relay works correctly (value handling)
 [ ] client clean finalization (free() etc on early cluster death)
 [ ] set ZMQ HWM to not fill up all memory on sockets; generalize socket
     creation call; might need to go to pub/sub so we drop instead of
     block
 [ ] break out valgrind and knock down any leaks

 [?] Change socket type or use NOBLOCK to prevent blocking?
 [?] client favor a slave for subs (requires a sort of "slave is alive"
     assurance).  just do master for now.
